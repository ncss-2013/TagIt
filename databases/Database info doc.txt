How to work the database:

It's pretty simple. There are basic functions for the three different classes: User, Tag and Photo


syntax for importing the database
import db   #db.py is the python code
from db import (class: User or Photo or whatever)



The variables within class User are:
    username
    password
    profilepicurl (optional)
    firstname
    lastname
    email
    country
    sex
    age
  

  
The variables within class Photo are:
    id
    latitude
    longitude
    description
    uploader
    uploaddate
    caption
    artist
    url
  


The variables within class Tag are:
    tagid
    tagstring
    id INTEGER   #of the photo that it was tagged with


  
The functions within User are (other than __init__):
    create
    getpassword(self)
    getprofilepicurl(self)
    getfirstname
    getlastname
    getcountry
    getsex
    getemail
    setpassword
    setemail
    setcountry
  

  
The functions within Photo are (other than __init__):
    create
    setprofilepicurl
    getallprofilepicurl
    getlocation
    getallphotos
    getpics     #not available for use yet
    
  

  
Example uses:


    user1 = User.create("username", "password", etc...) 

    user1.getpassword()
        # it will return 'password')

    user1.setpassword("12345")
        # it will replace the old password with '12345'

    user1.getpassword()
        # will now return '12345'

    # there are things that once set initially when the object is created cannot be changed (username, sex, age/birthday)
 
HOW TO CHECK IF USER EXISTS
    u = User("Alex Harper")
        u.exists()
            # Will return TRUE or FALSE
            # "Alex Harper" is the username to check!

    photo1 = Photo.create(uploader, caption, url, latitude=None, longitude=None, description=None, artist=None)
        # Only first three parameters are required!
        # Returns photo (Object) as

        a Photo (Class)

    photo1.setprofilepicurl()
        # changes the profile picture url. don't know how we are implementing photos


    
GET ALL PICTURE DETAILS WITH LIMIT
    Photo.getallpics(10)
        # This will get the first 10 pictures based on Increasing ID's in a List

OBTAIN SPECIFIC DETAILS FOR EACH IMAGE        
    photos = Photo.getallpics(10)
        for photo in photos:
            print(photo.url)
    # This will print all of the url's up to the 10th picture.
