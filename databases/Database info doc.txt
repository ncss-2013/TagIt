How to work the database:

It's pretty simple. There are basic functions for the two different classes: User and Photo
The variables within class User are:
    username
    password
    profilepicurl (optional)
    firstname
    lastname
    email
    country
    sex
    age
    
The variables within class Photo are:
    id
    latitude
    longitude
    description
    uploader
    uploaddate
    caption
    artist
    url
    
The functions within User are (other than __init__):
    create
    getpassword(self)
    getprofilepicurl(self)
    getfirstname
    getlastname
    getcountry
    getsex
    getemail
    setpassword
    setemail
    setcountry
    
The functions within Photo are (other than __init__):
    create
    setprofilepicurl
    getallprofilepicurl
    getlocation
    getallphotos
    getpics (not available for use yet)
    
    
Example uses:
    user1 = User.create("username", "password", etc...) 
    user1.getpassword()
        (it will return 'password')
    user1.setpassword("12345")
        (it will replace the old password with '12345')
    user1.getpassword()
        (will now return '12345')
    # there are things that once set initially when the object is created cannot be changed (username, sex, age/birthday)
        
    photo1 = Photo.create("id", "latitude", "longitude", etc...)
    photo1.setprofilepicurl()
        (changes the profile picture url. don't know how we are implementing photos)
    photo1.getallphotos()
        (literally gets all photos)
    photo1.getpics(criteria, order, limit)
